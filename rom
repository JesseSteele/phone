# ROMs are managed by a kind of secondary-bootup system called a "recovery"

# One recovery is "clockworkmod" AKA "CWM", another is "Team Win Recovery Project" AKA "TWRP"
## Android apps that backup/install a ROM actually use these, so those apps are not necessary



# Putting these on your phone should not hurt your current ROM or installation, even though most instructions sound like it will

# These allow you to backup your ROM, install a new ROM, etc, like wipe data (including your current ROM, so be careful)
# A ROM ranges from about 200MB to 2.5GB

# These instructions assume TWRP, but may apply to CWM

# Backup your ROM
## *You need space. If you "Wipe" stuff, wipe Cache etc, but avoid "boot" and anything the size of a ROM
## *To clear up space, Factory Reset is usually what you need.
## The recovery (CWM/TWRP) should do it for you. Here is a guide:

# Installing a ROM requires a .zip file to be on the device already
## There are many options for this...

# Add a ROM to the SD card directly
## Use "mount as disk" or something via Android
## Or just insert the SD to your computer and copy it

# *Copying vid adb push requires:
## Recovery mode (CWM/TWRP)
## Can't copy into root space, must be into a dir
## Must have a preceeding and trailing /
### Do not forget the trailing slash, best beloved/

# Add to the SD card in recovery
adb push romname.zip /data/media/
## Or
adb push romname.zip /sdcard/ROM/

# Add a new ROM to internal storage (no removable SD card, eg HTC)
## Boot into recovery mode (TWRP)
### Power, volume up/down
## Check connection
adb devices
### BLABLA9001SERIAL recovery
adb push romname.zip /sdcard/
