# You need to unlock the Bootloader first
## See adb-backup-unlock

# Rooting and ROM management is all done via Apps
## There are many complex ways, many proprietary apps and outdated scripts.
## This uses one proprietary app (ROM Toolbox Pro) and iRoot
## Root first

# Root your phone
http://www.iroot.com/
## Two versions: Windows, Android

## Windows instructions:
Install: Extract the .exe, right click: run as Administrator > more info, Run Anyway
On USB connect:
- Enable Debugging in Developer Options
- "Charge Only" AKA Settings > Wireless Networks > NFC / Media Device / MTP (off)
- Approve the Debugging connection on the phone
Follow the Wizard, allow apps to install, remain calm as phone reboots and does jumping jacks
Finished when you see "Rooted" somewhere in a pretty display on the phone
* It will install a new app store with "dangerous" cool apps. Keep it if you want.

## Android iRoot app instructions:
Download iRoot - Android, probably RomasterSu......apk
Settings > Security > allow installation from Unknown Sources
2 options to install:
## 1. Put the .apk in your phone-connected Dropbox
### Dropbox can install the .apk when you tap it
## 2. Copy to phone or SD card, maybe via "Mount as Disk" USB
### Use any .apk installer from Google Play, "Easy Installer" works great
Run iRoot and get root access.
Congrats, done!
